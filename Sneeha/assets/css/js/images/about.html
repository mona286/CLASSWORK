    Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat
    base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as
    various types of sausage, anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), which is then baked at
    a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.[1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person
    who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

    In Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork.[2][3]
    In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.

    The term pizza was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta
    in Lazio, on the border with Campania.[4] Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have
    since become popular in many countries.[5] It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common
    fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza),
    restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food.[5] Various food companies sell
    ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven.

    In 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000
    pizzerias.[6] Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.
